        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a software engineer, I've worked on a variety of projects in different industries, which has
            given me valuable experience in adapting to new challenges quickly. I'm good at collaborating with
            teams, including designers and managers, to deliver projects that meet user needs and business goals.
            I'm always eager to learn new things and stay updated on the latest technologies. I believe
            my skills, adaptability, teamwork, and passion for learning make me a strong candidate for any
            engineering role. Other than that I am creative at heart and so I love finding new ways to do things
            and new discoveries. But at the end of the day I know that, as per Socrates' wise words, The only true
            wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ol>
                <li id="list">Football</li>
                <p>Football isn't just a hobby for meâ€”it's a passion that ignites my spirit and
                    fills me with joy, from the thrill of the game to the sense of community it fosters.</p>
                <li id="list">Video Editting</li>
                <p>Video editing is my creative playground where I bring stories to life through the magic
                    of visual storytelling and digital craftsmanship.</p>
                <li id="list">Watching Films</li>
                <p>I love diving into captivating stories, exploring diverse worlds, and experiencing a
                    spectrum of emotions through the lens of cinema.</p>
                <li id="list">Writing</li>
                <p>Writing is my sanctuary, where I craft worlds, weave stories, and express my deepest
                    thoughts and emotions through the power of words.</p>
                <li id="list">Listening to music</li>
                <p>Melodies transport me to different realms, emotions flow freely, and every beat
                    becomes a part of my soul's rhythm.</p>

            <h2>Spirit Animal</h2>
            <P>I believe my spirit animal is a sloth, not because I think I'm lazy, but because
                I believe that these wonderous creatures reflect my laid back nature. I believe
                that in this life, we don't need to worry about things we can't control, instead
                we need to constantly immerse ourselves in the present, and in this way, enjoy the
                fullness of the human experience.</P>
            <p id="sloth">Spirit animals are sort of like a special friend in the spirit realm,
                a companion who watches over us and guides us along our journey through life.</p>

            <p id="funfact">Fun Fact: Despite their slow-moving nature, sloths are
                actually excellent swimmers! They can even hold their breath for up to 40 minutes underwater!</p>
